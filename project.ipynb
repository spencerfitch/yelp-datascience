    "### Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to understand any underlying biases or trends on Yelp by answering the following questions:\n",
    "1. Is there a correlation between a user's activity/popularity and their review score distribution?\n",
    "2. Do Yelp users have similar behaviors to their friends on the platform?\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between review score and whether it was made during the business' operating hours?\n",
    "4. Is there a correlation between number of reviews on a business and its score distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Used\n",
    "All of these questions were answered using various data sources included in the Yelp Open Dataset. The specific files used for each question are listed below:\n",
    "1. user.json, checkin.json, review.json\n",
    "2. user.json, checkin.json, review.json\n",
    "3. business.json, review.json\n",
    "4. business.json, review.json"
